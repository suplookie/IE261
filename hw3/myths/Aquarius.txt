 Aquarius is the 11th sign in the Zodiac and represents those born between Jan. 20 and Feb. 18.
 Aquarius, the Water Bearer, comes from the story of the Deucalion Flood. Zeus poured all the waters from the heavens out onto the Earth to wash away and destroy the wicked and evil men. This brought forth a fresh start for Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha, who threw stones over their shoulders to create a new race of men and women. This sign is also associated with Ganymede, the cupbearer of Olympus.
 According to Astrology Aquarius is an air sign characterized by cleverness, humanism and originality.
