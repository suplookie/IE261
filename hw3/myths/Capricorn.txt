 Capricorn is the tenth sign in the Zodiac and represents those born between Dec. 22 and Jan. 19.
 Capricorn is usually depicted as a goat or sea-goat, but in Greek Mythology he is the God Pan. Pan ruled over forests and woodlands, flocks and shepherds. From the waist down he was a goat and also had the ears and horns of a goat, and from the waist up he was a man. He was a horny little guy and was always trying to catch a nymph, who would flee because of his appearance. He, eventually, became the God of Nature, and some of his qualities, such as sexuality and love of nature have become part of the character of people born under this sign. Another story is that the goat nymph, Amalthea, who suckled Zeus as an infant, was placed among the stars as the constellation Capricorn by Zeus in gratitude.
 According to Astrology Capricorn is an earth sign and people born under this sign are responsible, patient, ambitious and loyal.
