 Pisces is the 12th sign in the Zodiac and represents those born between Feb. 20 and March 20.
 Pisces is the fishes. In Greek Mythology, these two fish were Aphrodite and Eros. They were walking along the Euphrates River when Typhon appeared. They were scared and unable to run, so they called upon Zeus for help. He turned them into two fish, and they jumped in the river and escaped. Athena placed the fish among the stars and they became the constellation of Pisces.
 According to Astrology Pisces is a water sign and people born under this sign are compassionate, adaptable, devoted and imaginative.
