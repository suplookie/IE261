 Scorpio is the eighth sign in the Zodiac and represents those born between Oct. 24 and Nov. 22. 
 Scorpio, in Greek Mythology, comes from the story of Orion. This giant of a man was the son of Poseidon and Euryale, and was also said to be the most handsome man alive. He and Artemis were hunting partners. This made her brother, Apollo, jealous. He went to Mother Earth and asked her to create a giant scorpion, which then stung and killed Orion. Zeus placed both of them in the heavens as a constellation. Scorpion is a pretty big constellation. The bright star, Antares, is the Scorpion's heart.
 According to Astrology Scorpio is a water sign and the traits of those born under the sign include determination and loyalty.
