 Taurus, the Bull, is the second sign in the Zodiac and represents those born between April 20 and May 20.
 Taurus, comes from the story of Europa. She was the daughter of King Agenor of Phoenicia and Telephassa. Europa became the object of Zeus' affections, and he appeared to her as a beautiful, white bull at the Phoenician waterside. The princess was awestruck by the beauty of the bull and walked over to pet it. She then climbed upon his back at which Zeus jumped into the water and carried her across the sea to Crete. He took the form of an eagle there and ravished her. She eventually bore him three sons whose names were Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Sarpedon.
 Zeus placed the image of the bull in the heavens. A group of stars called the Hyades make up Taurus' head, and another group of stars called the Pleiades make up part of the bull, as well. The Pleiades are a bright galactic cluster and the brightest seven make up their own constellation.
 According to Astrology Taurus is an Earth sign and the traits of those born under the sign of Taurus include practicality and stubborness.
